    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/IMG_6649.jpg" alt="A selfie of me at the peak of Stone Mountain, GA" class="about-image">
    <p>Hi! My name is Kristin (she/her), and I am a third-year Computational Media major who is currently attending
      the Georgia Institute of Technology. Computational media is essentially a combination of computer science and 
      liberal arts. The interdisciplinary nature of this major is what drew me towards it, and it offers numerous 
      opportunities for how it can be applied. For instance, animation, graphic design, and game development fall under the category.
      Over the course of my time here, I have been learning how to code in Python, Java, and more. By using my artistic
    skills in conjunction with my technical skills, I aspire to do equitable software development post-graduation.</p>
